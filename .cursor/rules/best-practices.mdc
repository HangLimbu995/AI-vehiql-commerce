# Best Practices

## Component Guidelines
- Keep components focused and single-responsibility
- Use TypeScript for better type safety and developer experience
- Implement responsive design using Tailwind's mobile-first approach
- Use semantic HTML elements for better accessibility

## Styling Guidelines
- Use Tailwind's utility classes for styling
- Follow consistent spacing using Tailwind's spacing scale
- For responsive designs:
  1. Start with mobile layout
  2. Add `sm:`, `md:`, `lg:` breakpoints as needed
  3. Use consistent width progressions (e.g., w-[90px] → w-[120px] → w-[150px])
  4. Add transitions for smooth responsive changes

## Performance
- Use Next.js Image component for optimized images
- Implement proper loading states
- Keep bundle size minimal by avoiding unnecessary imports
- Use server components where possible to reduce client-side JavaScript
